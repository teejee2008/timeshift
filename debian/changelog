timeshift (18.1.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Fixed an issue where home directory would get deleted while
  restoring rsync snapshot. This happened in scenarios where the user
  had created a snapshot excluding home directory, and later
  restored the snapshot after including home directory in Settings.
  To avoid such scenarios, user-specified include filters
  will be ignored for restore. Exclude list that was created during
  snapshot creation will be used instead, along with any additional
  exclude filters.

  notification. "notify-send" is not available on some systems.

  will open web browser as non-admin user.
