timeshift (18.1.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Fixed an issue where home directory would get deleted while

  had created a snapshot excluding home directory, and later
  restored the snapshot after including home directory in Settings.
  To avoid such scenarios, user-specified include filters
  will be ignored for restore. Exclude list that was created during
  snapshot creation will be used instead, along with any additional
  exclude filters.
